# TS4 Block Generate Outfit

This mods prevents that TS4 generates new outfits for sims if an outfit exist.

If an outfit is missing the mod always allows the creation of the missing outfit.

Mods can still replace outfits without generating them, they will not be blocked. 
There might be other ways for TS4 to replace outfits, so it is not 100 % safe.

## Usage
To replace special outfit with a custom one the easiest thing is to copy the outfit from an existing outfit.
I suggest to use [CopyOutfits](https://github.com/Oops19/TS4-CopyOutfits) and create the desired outfit in CAS as Everyday.1 or something like this.
Back in game change the outfit to Everyday.1 and copy it.
Paste it to the special outfit which should be replaced permanently.

### Configuration
The default configuration is stored in `The Sims 4/mod_data/block_generate_outfits/block_generate_outfits.txt` and can be easily altered.
It blocks only BATHING.0 and SPECIAL.1.

To use cheat commands enable the cheat console (Shift+Ctrl+C `testingcheats true`).
* `o19.bgo.help` shows a brief help.
* `o19.bgo.toggle` to disable and enable this mod temporarily.
* `o19.bgo.edit + EVERYDAY 4` will prevent that also the 5th 'Everyday' outfit gets replaced, even though this should never be re-generated.
* `o19.bgo.edit - SPECIAL 1` will remove the Special.1 outfit from the list.

All edit and toggle commands are not persisted, after starting the game the mod is active and the settings read from the configuration file apply.


# Addendum

## Game compatibility
This mod has been tested with `The Sims 4` 1.118.257, S4CL 3.15, TS4Lib 0.3.42.
It is expected to be compatible with many upcoming releases of TS4, S4CL and TS4Lib.

## Removal of the mod
The mod installation with unzip writes to a few directories.
To remove this mod and all related files locate the files and folders and remove them:
* `The Sims 4/Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.*`
* `The Sims 4/mod_data/_o19_/$mod_name/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_documentation/_o19_/$mod_name/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_sources/_o19_/$mod_name/`

To remove all of my mods locate these folders and remove them:
* `The Sims 4/Mods/_o19_/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_data/_o19_/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_documentation/_o19_/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_sources/_o19_/`
 
## Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_sources/$mod_name/*`
* CAS and build-buy UGC without scripts will create `Mods/o19/$mod_name.package`.
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.
* `mod_documentation/$mod_name/` and/or `mod_sources/$mod_name/` are not required and can be deleted.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this.
You can extract the ZIP file to a temporary directory and copy the folders manually.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_sources` are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.

## Troubleshooting
When installed properly this is not necessary at all.
For manual installations check these things and make sure each question can be answered with 'yes'.
* Does 'The Sims 4' (localized to Die Sims 4, Les Sims 4, Los Sims 4, The Sims 4, ...) exist?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the folder `Mods`?
    * Does `Mods` contain the folder `_o19_`? 
      * Does `_19_` contain `ts4lib.ts4script` and `ts4lib.package` files?
      * Does `_19_` contain `{mod_name}.ts4script` and/or `{mod_name}.package` files?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the folder `mod_data`?
    * Does `mod_data` contain the folder `{mod_name}`?
      * Does `{mod_name}` contain files or folders?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the `mod_logs` ?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt`?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `TS4-Library_*_Messages.txt`?
      * Is this the most recent version or can it be updated?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`?
      * Is this the most recent version or can it be updated?
  * Doesn't `The Sims 4` contain the file(s) `last_exception.txt`  and/or `last_exception*.txt` ?
* Share the `The Sims 4/mod_logs/Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt` and `The Sims 4/mod_logs/{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`  file.
