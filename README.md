# TS4 Block Generate Outfit

This mods prevents that TS4 generates new outfits for sims if an outfit exist.

If an outfit is missing the mod always allows the creation of the missing outfit.

Mods can still replace outfits without generating them, they will not be blocked. 
There might be other ways for TS4 to replace outfits, so it is not 100 % safe.

## Usage
To replace special outfit with a custom one the easiest thing is to copy the outfit from an existing outfit.
I suggest to use [CopyOutfits](https://github.com/Oops19/TS4-CopyOutfits) and create the desired outfit in CAS as Everyday.1 or something like this.
Back in game change the outfit to Everyday.1 and copy it.
Paste it to the special outfit which should be replaced permanently.

### Configuration
The default configuration is stored in `The Sims 4/mod_data/block_generate_outfits/block_generate_outfits.txt` and can be easily altered.
It blocks only BATHING.0 and SPECIAL.1.

To use cheat commands enable the cheat console (Shift+Ctrl+C `testingcheats true`).
* `o19.bgo.help` shows a brief help.
* `o19.bgo.toggle` to disable and enable this mod temporarily.
* `o19.bgo.edit + EVERYDAY 4` will prevent that also the 5th 'Everyday' outfit gets replaced, even though this should never be re-generated.
* `o19.bgo.edit - SPECIAL 1` will remove the Special.1 outfit from the list.

All edit and toggle commands are not persisted, after starting the game the mod is active and the settings read from the configuration file apply.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.
